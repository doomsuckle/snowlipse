# snowlipse
ellipse on snow

This is a simple test package to show creating a package and a script in a package that can be run from the command line to generate a 400x600 image that has an ellipse with some random background.

## install

* check out repo

* create and start python virtual environment:
```
> virtual env venv
> source venv/bin/activate
```

* install the package: `pip install -e .` 

* you should now see a script in the background that can be run with: `> snowlipse-toy ` that will generate a file: `img-toy.png`
